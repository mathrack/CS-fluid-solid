The present folder contains the data and source code used to perform the LES of the turbulent channel flow with conjugate heat transfer with a friction Reynolds number of 1020 and a Prandtl number of 0.71.

The folder *csv* contains various 1D profiles in wall-units. They are stored in *.csv* files and were generated with scilab:

    scilab -f wale_1020_pr071.sce

The folder *data* is a temporary folder. It contains a bash script that creates symbolic links to the simulation results.

The folder *raw* contains the simulation results. They are stored in 1D text files and were generated by our post-processing tools.

The folder *src_saturne* contains the source code used to perform the simulation. To save CPU time, we used larger time steps during the transient, as visible in the listing.

The file *listing* contains the first and last 5000 lines of the listing of our LES.

The file *wale_1020_pr071.xlsm* contains our csv results and allows to quickly plot and manipulate them. The file contains a macro to automatically import the results using a relative path. To import them, open the file, press Alt+F8 and run the macro named *MacroN*. As excel macros are often considered a security issue, we have copy-pasted its content below so you can safely reproduce it.
